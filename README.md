## Awesome Startup Employee Directory

This project makes use of several pretty sweet JavaScript features and Web API's to build a dynamic page that displays a list of random employees that work at an "Awesome Startup Company."

When displaying the webpage you will see 12 random employees rendered, each with their own card. The random employees are rendered using the https://randomuser.me/ API and the fetch() API. The employee directory will display more specific information about an employee by selecting an employee card. Once selected a modal window will display with the additional employee information. The directory offers the sweet functionality to toggle to the previous or next employee in the directory all while in the modal window.
